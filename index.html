        <p id="para1" class="paragraph"><strong> <u> Spider-Man: No Way Home </u></strong> is a 2021 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)</i>  and <i> Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)</i>, and is the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is directed by <em> Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers </em>, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but it breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe.</p>

        <p id="para2">A third <abbr title=" Marvel Cinematic Universe "> MCU</abbr> Spider-Man film was planned during the production of Homecoming in 2017. By August 2019, negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project; however, a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the two companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return at that time. Filming began in October 2020 in New York City, before moving to Atlanta later that month and wrapping at the end of March 2021. No Way Home explores the concept of the multiverse and ties the MCU to past Spider-Man film series, with numerous actors—including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield—reprising their roles from the Sam Raimi and Marc Webb-directed Spider-Man films. Maguire and Garfield's return was the subject of intense speculation, and Sony and Marvel attempted to conceal their involvement ahead of release, despite numerous leaks from the films production.</p>
